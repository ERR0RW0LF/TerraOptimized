This video will be my first video on my channel so it should contain some info about me and what I plan on doing. 

Who I am:
I'm a student with self teach skills in programming mostly python but also a bit in Rust and C++ ( maybe show some kind of project of mine)

What I plan on doing:
Develop things (hardware, games, mods, programs)

Give a reason for continuing to follow me on my path.


My main game idea TerraOptimized

What I want to reveal about the game
What my inspiration is (Minecraft, TerraFirmaCraft, Vintage Story)
How my game is to differentiate itself (more realism)

What I plan to reveal:
Custom Voxel Engine
Crafting 
Difficulties (AI generated need to decide later):

Lower Difficulty Levels (Less Realistic):

* Relaxed: Focuses on enjoyment without harsh realism.
* Casual: Offers a forgiving experience with guidance.
* Assisted: Provides hints and simplifies mechanics.
* Guided: Clearly explains game systems and consequences.
* Simplified: Removes or automates complex elements.
* Forgiving: Tolerates mistakes and offers second chances.

Mid-Range Difficulty Levels (Increasing Realism):

* Standard: A balanced experience with some realistic elements.
* Normal: The intended way to experience the core mechanics.
* Challenging: Introduces more realistic consequences and fewer aids.
* Immersive: Aims for a believable experience with less hand-holding.
* Authentic: Starts to emphasize realistic systems and limitations.

Higher Difficulty Levels (More Realistic):

* Realistic: Emphasizes true-to-life mechanics and consequences.
* Simulation: Focuses on accurately replicating real-world systems.
* Survival: Highlights the challenges of realistic resource management.
* Hardcore: Offers a brutal and unforgivingly realistic experience.
* Grounded: Removes abstractions and forces players to engage with raw realism.
* Uncompromising: Makes no concessions to ease of play in favor of realism.

Extreme Difficulty Levels (Beyond Realistic):

* Overkill: Exaggerates realistic challenges to an extreme degree.
* Grim: A bleak and punishingly realistic experience.
* Ironclad: Imposes severe and realistic limitations.
* Verisimilitude: Strives for the highest possible level of realism, potentially beyond enjoyable gameplay for some.
* Meticulous: Requires careful and realistic planning and execution.

Threats for the player

What I want to avoid:
No fictive Monsters
Giving up
Using AI to generate a lot of code

What I would like to add but don't know how:
Chemical realism
	Realistic interactions between chemicals 

Show what I already have:
Nothing to show just my ideas
