This video will be my first video on my channel so it should contain some info about me and what I plan on doing. 

## Who I am:
I'm a student with self teach skills in programming mostly python but also a bit in Rust and C++ (maybe show some kind of project of mine)

## What I plan on doing:
Develop things (hardware, games, mods, programs)

Give a reason for continuing to follow me on my path.


My main game idea TerraOptimized

## What I want to reveal about the game
What my inspiration is (Minecraft, TerraFirmaCraft, Vintage Story)
How my game is to differentiate itself (more realism)

## What I plan to reveal:
<details>
	
<summary>Custom Voxel Engine</summary>

<summary>Crafting</summary>

Realism 
At the start only having things available that are laying around
No Crafting recipes at the start (just figure it out)
Crafting recipes need to be written down by the player in a Memory UI that gets cleared every time they die (depends on difficulty)
Proficiency in crafting (allows players to later specialize on servers)
Difficulty of crafting different things, so some things have a lower success rate if you aren’t good at it.
Differentiation between ways of crafting so if you’re good in one doesn’t mean you’re good in everything else.

<summary>Difficulties (AI generated need to decide later): </summary>

### Lower Difficulty Levels (Less Realistic):

* Relaxed: Focuses on enjoyment without harsh realism.
* Casual: Offers a forgiving experience with guidance.
* Assisted: Provides hints and simplifies mechanics.
* Guided: Clearly explains game systems and consequences.
* Simplified: Removes or automates complex elements.
* Forgiving: Tolerates mistakes and offers second chances.

### Mid-Range Difficulty Levels (Increasing Realism):

* Standard: A balanced experience with some realistic elements.
* Normal: The intended way to experience the core mechanics.
* Challenging: Introduces more realistic consequences and fewer aids.
* Immersive: Aims for a believable experience with less hand-holding.
* Authentic: Starts to emphasize realistic systems and limitations.

### Higher Difficulty Levels (More Realistic):

* Realistic: Emphasizes true-to-life mechanics and consequences.
* Simulation: Focuses on accurately replicating real-world systems.
* Survival: Highlights the challenges of realistic resource management.
* Hardcore: Offers a brutal and unforgivingly realistic experience.
* Grounded: Removes abstractions and forces players to engage with raw realism.
* Uncompromising: Makes no concessions to ease of play in favor of realism.

### Extreme Difficulty Levels (Beyond Realistic):

* Overkill: Exaggerates realistic challenges to an extreme degree.
* Grim: A bleak and punishingly realistic experience.
* Ironclad: Imposes severe and realistic limitations.
* Verisimilitude: Strives for the highest possible level of realism, potentially beyond enjoyable gameplay for some.
* Meticulous: Requires careful and realistic planning and execution.

Chemical realism
	Realistic interactions between chemicals 

## Show what I already have:
Nothing to show just my ideas
