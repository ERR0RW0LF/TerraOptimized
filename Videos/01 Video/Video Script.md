# Script

Welcome to my Chanel, I'm WOLF. I wanted to introduce myself and my project.

So, where do I start? I have been doing programming for 3 years. My most used language is Python cous it was easy to learn at the start, but I have started learning Rust and C++ and have used Java for one small Minecraft mod.

It was hard to overcome my fear of speaking on the internet. For some stupid reason I have developed an extreme fear of interactions with people on the internet.

So, my plan is to share some projects of mine here. So, Devlogs and Showcases.

I have started planning my first project, but I chose one of the worst first projects and I can't stop now. Please be patient. But I have decided to let you at least in on some info. First and foremost, in want to avoid using AI for this project so I will need to rely on finding information on my one, all art needs to be “hand” maid generating using math and code is allowed, no ai “written” code, no ai for debugging etc. You may see why this project will take forever. 

Next up I want to reveal what my project is. It’s a game inspired by Minecraft, Vintage Story and the Minecraft mod TerraFirmaCraft. 

Thanks for listening to me until now I real appreciate you.
