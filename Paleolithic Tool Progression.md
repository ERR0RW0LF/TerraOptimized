[[Lower Paleolithic]]

- 3.3 Mya – 2.6 Mya: Stone tools - found in modern-day Kenya are older and only found on the archetype road. Ancient stone tools from Ethiopia (Oldowan) were hand-crafted by Australopithecus or related people.
- 2.3 Mya: Earliest likely control of fire and cooking, by Homo habilis
- 1.76 Mya: Advanced (Acheulean) stone tools in Kenya by Homo erectus
- 1.75 Mya – 150 kya: Varying estimates for the origin of language
- 1.5 Mya: Bone tools in Africa by Homo erectus
- 900 kya – 40 kya: Boats
- 500 kya: Hafting in South Africa by Homo heidelbergensis
- 500 kya – 450 kya: Woodworking construction in Zambia by Homo heidelbergensis (The oldest known surviving buildings are made from stone and date back no more than 9,500 years.)
- 420 – 200 kya: Food storage in the form of uncracked bones saved for their marrow in Qesem cave, Israel.
- 400 kya: Pigments in Zambia by Homo heidelbergensis
- 400 kya – 300 kya: Spears in Germany likely by Homo heidelbergensis

[[Middle Paleolithic]]

- 320 kya: The trade and long-distance transportation of resources (e.g. obsidian), use of pigments, and possible making of projectile points in Kenya
- 279 kya: Hafting and early stone-tipped projectile weapons in Ethiopia
- 200 kya: Simple glue (adhesive) made of one kind of material, birch tar, in Central Italy by Neanderthals.
- 200 kya: Beds in South Africa.
- 170 kya – 90 kya: Clothing, among anatomically modern humans in Africa. Genetic evidence from body lice suggests a range of dates centering over 100 thousand years ago. The first bone scrapers appropriate for scraping hides to make supple leather were found in Morocco dating to 90–120,000 years ago.
- 164 kya – 47 kya: Heat treating of stone blades in South Africa.
- 135 kya – 100 kya: Beads in Israel and Algeria
- 100 kya: Compound paints made in South Africa
- 100 kya: Funerals (in the form of burial) in Israel
- 90 kya: Harpoons in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
- 70 kya – 60 kya in Sibudu Cave in South Africa by Homo sapiens:
    - Compound adhesives
    - Arrows and other evidence of bow-and-arrow technology
    - Sewing needle
- 61 kya – 62 kya: Cave painting in Spain by Neanderthal
- 55.8–51.2 kya: Representational and Narrative art in Indonesia by Homo sapiens

[[Upper Paleolithic]] to Early [[Mesolithic or Epipaleolithic]]

- 49 kya – 30 kya: Ground stone tools – fragments of an axe in Australia date to 49–45 ka, more appear in Japan closer to 30 ka, and elsewhere closer to the Neolithic.
- 47 kya: The oldest-known mines in the world are from Eswatini, and extracted hematite for the production of the red pigment ochre.
- 45 kya – 9 kya: Earliest evidence of shoes, suggested by changes in foot bone morphology in China by Tianyuan man. The earliest physical shoes found so far are bark sandals dated to 10 to 9 kya in Fort Rock Cave, United States.
- 44 kya – 42 kya: Tally sticks (see Lebombo bone) in Eswatini
- 42 kya: Flute in Germany
- 37 kya: Mortar and pestle in Southwest Asia
- 32-28 kya: Rope and Cords for "hafting stone tools, weaving baskets, or sewing garments," according to Elis Kvavadze et al.
- 31 kya: Amputation and surgery. Medicine in a meaningful sense likely predates the human-chimpanzee split, as, for example, herbal medicine has been observed in other primates.
- 28 kya: Ceramics (direct evidence) and weaving (impressions left in the ceramics) in Moravia (Czech Republic) and Georgia. (The oldest piece of woven cloth found so far was in Çatalhöyük, Turkey and dated to about 9,000 years ago.)
- 24 kya: Oldest known ceramic sculpture
- 23 kya: Domestication of the dog in Siberia.
- 22 – 17 kya Bullroarer
- 22 kya: Fish hook in Okinawa Island, modern day Japan.
- 21 – 3.7 kya: Star chart in France, and later Spain, Kashmir, Germany, and Egypt.
- 17.5 kya: Spear-thrower (atlatl), found in France.
- 16 kya: Pottery in China
- 14.5 kya: Bread in Jordan
- 12 kya: Spindle whorl, also the oldest wheel-like tool, at Nahal Ein Gev II (Israel)
