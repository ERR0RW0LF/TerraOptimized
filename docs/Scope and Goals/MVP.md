# MVP - TerraOptimized

## Engine MVP (Must-Have)

- Render a window with a colored background
- Basic input handling (keyboard/mouse)
- Load and display a static 3D voxel chunk
- Modular code structure (separate rendering, input, and world logic)

## Engine MVP (Stretch Goals)

- Multithreading (Physics and Rendering)
- Rendering optimizations (frustum culling, etc.)

## Game MVP (Must-Have)

- Simple procedural world generation (one chunk)
- Basic player movement (WASD to move a block or simple character)
- Place and remove blocks (basic terrain modification)
- Display a simple player character (e.g., a colored cube)
- Inventory UI (can pick up and place at least two block types)

## Game MVP (Stretch Goals)

- World interactions: e.g., picking up an item, opening a door
- Simple entities: e.g., a moving animal or NPC
- Save/load world

## Videos MVP

- Animations to show key features
- Keep videos 15-30 minutes
- Consistent style (dark background, color palette)
- Show progress and explain challenges/solutions
